#Filtering patser output data

 Patser is run using the "-li" option which sets the p-value cut-off based on the sample size adjusted information content.
 
  A: look at the distribution of the scores given by patser then determine the cutoffs of 10% and 5 % tail of score distribution.

    B: keep the genes in 10% and 5 % tail of score distribution for downstream analysis.

# analysis after patser

A)  count the numbers of binding sites for each gene in 10 and 5 % tail of score distribution with each TF motif (PWM) of interest -consider as number of binding sites 

                                     `count.pl`
                                     
      input file (TF_results_patser_scores_5_10.txt) :  names and scores of the genes in 10 and 5% tail of score distribution
      
      output file (number_binding_sites_TF.txt) : name and numbers of each gene in 10 and 5% tail of score distribution
                             


B) calculate the average of  binding scores for each gene has more than one binding sit in 10 and 5 % tail of score distribution with each TF motif (PWM)of interest --consider as average of strength of TF binding sites 

                                             `average_binding_score.pl`
                     
        input file (TF_results_patser_scores_5_10.txt) :  names and scores of the genes in 10 and 5% tail of score distribution
        
        output file (TF.avg.txt) : name and average strength binding of each gene in 10 and 5% tail of score distribution

C) get genes_name,number of binding sites and average of binding sore for each gene in 10 and 5% tail of score distribution with each TF motif (PWM) of interest

                                     `countnumber_bindingscore.pl`
                                     
              inputfile 1: number_binding_sites_TF.txt
              
              inputfile 2: TF.avg.txt
              
              output file : genes_names_count_average_tf.txt

D) get genes_name , number of binding sites , average of binding sites , co-variation of each gene in 10 and 5% tail of score distribution with each TF motif (PWM) of interest

                              `genes_numbers_score_expression.pl`
                              
                   inputfile 1 : genes_names_count_average_tf.txt 
                   
                  inputfile 2 : expression_covariation_tf_14.txt (expression covariation of each TF of interest with 7805 genes).
                  
                  outputfile : genes_names_count_average_expression_covariation_tf.txt

E)  keep the genes which have more than two binding sites then divide those genes into genes have positive and negative covariation with each TF of interest 

                                    `more_two_binding_sites_negative_positive.pl` 
                                    
                       input file 1 : genes_names_count_average_expression_covariation_tf.txt
                       
                       output file 1: negative.txt ( genes have more than two binding sites and negative covariation with TF)
                       
                       output file 2 : positive.txt (genes have more than two binding sites and positive covariation with TF)

F)  spearman correlations is done by R for positive.txt and negative.txt  to estimate the correlation between the number of binding sites and expressioncovariation as well as between average strength binding and expressioncovariation of each TF of interest.
